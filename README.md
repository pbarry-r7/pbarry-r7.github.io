This is a PRE-RELEASE version of an Outlook add-in for reporting phishing emails to Rapid7.

The base for this code was originally generated by [Yo Office](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office), which, itself, utilzied code from an [example Outlook add-in provided by Microsoft](https://github.com/jasonjoh/command-demo).  Both of these operate under MIT licenses.
